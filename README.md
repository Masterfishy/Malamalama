# Malamalama

A game I developed that I used for a school project.  Art was made with the help of a friend.
Made with learning outcomes in mind: spatial awareness and perseverence.

You are lost in a cave in total darkness.  Find your way to the button which will light your path to the exit using the arrow keys.

Made in Pygame.

## Update!

I have updated the game to be run with `Python 3.9`.  To run the game you will need Pygame.

### To install pygame:
```
pip install pygame
```

### To play Malamalama
```
python Malamalama3.py
```
